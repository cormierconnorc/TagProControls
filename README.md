TagProControls
==============

A very simple app that adds usable controls to the online game TagPro, allowing it to be played on an Android device. This is not a port of the full game to Android, and thus will perform poorly on most devices (as the new Android 4.4 Chromium webview doesn't support hardware acceleration for an HTML5 canvas).
